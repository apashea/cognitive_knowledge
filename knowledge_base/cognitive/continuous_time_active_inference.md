# Continuous-Time Active Inference

This note explores the mathematical and cognitive foundations of continuous-time active inference, bridging [[free_energy_principle|free energy principles]] with continuous-time dynamical systems.

## Core Concepts

### Mathematical Foundations
- [[variational_calculus|Variational Calculus]] framework for continuous-time optimization
- [[differential_geometry|Differential Geometry]] of belief manifolds
- [[path_integral|Path Integral]] formulation of belief trajectories
- [[generalized_coordinates|Generalized Coordinates]] for representing continuous dynamics

### Cognitive Architecture
- [[predictive_coding|Predictive Coding]] in continuous time
- [[hierarchical_processing|Hierarchical Processing]] of sensory streams
- [[neural_computation|Neural Computation]] implementation
- [[bayesian_brain|Bayesian Brain]] perspective

## Mathematical Framework

### Free Energy in Continuous Time
The [[free_energy|Free Energy]] functional in continuous time is given by:

```math
F[q] = ∫ dt [⟨ln q(s(t)) - ln p(o(t),s(t))⟩_q]
```

where:
- q(s(t)) is the [[variational_inference|variational density]] over states
- p(o(t),s(t)) is the [[generative_model|generative model]]
- ⟨·⟩_q denotes expectation under q

### Belief Dynamics
[[belief_updating|Belief updating]] follows gradient flows on the [[information_geometry|information geometric]] manifold:

```math
∂_t q(s) = -κ ∂_s F[q]
```

where κ is a [[temperature_parameter|temperature parameter]] controlling update speed.

### Action Selection
[[action_selection|Action selection]] minimizes [[expected_free_energy|Expected Free Energy]] through:

```math
a = -∂_a G
```

where G is the path integral of expected free energy:

```math
G = ∫ dt [⟨ln q(s(t)) - ln p(o(t),s(t)|π)⟩_q]
```

## Relationship to Discrete Models

The continuous-time formulation generalizes [[active_inference_pomdp|discrete POMDP]] approaches:
- State transitions become differential equations
- Discrete actions become continuous control signals
- Belief updates become gradient flows
- [[path_integral_free_energy|Path integral free energy]] replaces discrete sums
