## Overview

Learning Theory encompasses the principles and mechanisms by which cognitive systems acquire, modify, and maintain knowledge and skills through experience. This framework integrates multiple levels of analysis, from neural plasticity to behavioral change, explaining how organisms adapt to their environment.

## Core Principles

### Basic Learning Types
- [[learning_forms]] - Learn kinds
  - [[associative_learning]] - Link learn
