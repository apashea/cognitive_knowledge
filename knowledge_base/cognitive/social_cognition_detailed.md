## Overview

Social Cognition encompasses the cognitive processes involved in understanding, interacting with, and learning from other people. This complex system integrates multiple cognitive functions to enable social perception, interaction, cultural learning, and the development of social competence across the lifespan.

## Core Components

### Social Perception
- [[person_perception]] - People see
