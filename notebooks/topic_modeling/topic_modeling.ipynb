It extends the [[free_energy_principle]] to explain how adaptive systems maintain their integrity through dynamic interactions with their environment. This framework bridges the gap between [[perception]], [[action]], and [[learning]] by casting them all as processes of [[inference]] under a single mathematical framework.\\n\\n## Core Principles\\n\\n### Free Energy Minimization\\n- [[free_energy_minimization]] -

This document outlines the key concepts, mathematical foundations, and implementations of continuous-time active inference.\\n\\n## Mathematical Foundations\\n\\n### Continuous-Time Free Energy Principle\\n\\nThe Free Energy Principle (FEP) in continuous time is formulated as a path integral of variational free energy over time:\\n\\n```math\\nF = ∫ F(x(t), μ(t), a(t)) dt\\n```\\n\\nwhere:\\n- x(t) represents the true hidden states\\n- μ(t) represents internal states (expectations)\\n- a(t) represents actions\\n\\nThe variational free energy can be decomposed into:\\n\\n```math\\nF = E_q[ln q(x) - ln p(x,y)] = D_KL[q(x)||p(x|y)] - ln p(y)\\n```\\n\\nwhere:\\n- q(x) is the recognition density\\n- p(x,y) is the generative model\\n- D_KL is the Kullback-Leibler divergence\\n\\n### Generative Model\\n\\nThe continuous-time generative model is defined by stochastic differential equations:\\n\\n```math\\ndx = f(x,v,θ)dt + σ_x dW_x\\ndy = g(x,θ)dt + σ_y dW_y\\n```\\n\\nwhere:\\n- f(x,v,θ) is the flow function describing dynamics\\n- g(x,θ) is the observation function\\n- σ_x, σ_y are noise terms\\n- dW_x, dW_y are Wiener processes\\n\\n#### Extended Generative Model Components\\n\\n1. **Flow Function Decomposition**:\\n```math\\nf(x,v,θ) = f_0(x,θ) + f_1(x,θ)v + f_2(x,θ)v^2 + ...\\n```\\n\\n2. **Hierarchical Structure**:\\n```math\\ndx_i = f_i(x_i, x_{i+1})dt + σ_i dW_i\\n```\\n\\n3. **Precision Parameters**:\\n```math\\nΠ_x = (σ_x σ_x^T)^{-1}\\nΠ_y = (σ_y σ_y^T)^{-1}\\n```\\n\\n## Core Components\\n\\n### 1. State Estimation\\n\\nContinuous-time state estimation involves solving:\\n\\n```math\\ndμ/dt = Dμ - ∂F/∂μ\\n```\\n\\nwhere:\\n- Dμ is a temporal derivative operator\\n- ∂F/∂μ is the gradient of free energy\\n\\n#### Recognition Dynamics\\n\\nThe recognition dynamics can be expanded as:\\n\\n```math\\ndμ/dt = Dμ - (∂_μ ε_x^T Π_x ε_x + ∂_μ ε_y^T Π_y ε_y)\\n```\\n\\nwhere:\\n- ε_x = Dμ - f(μ,v,θ) (dynamics prediction error)\\n- ε_y = y - g(μ,θ) (sensory prediction error)\\n\\n### 2. Action Selection\\n\\nAction selection in continuous time follows:\\n\\n```math\\nda/dt = -∂F/∂a = -∂_a ε_y^T Π_y ε_y\\n```\\n\\n#### Active Inference Implementation\\n\\n1. **Sensorimotor Integration**:\\n```python\\ndef compute_action_gradient(self):\\n    sensory_pe = self.compute_sensory_prediction_error()\\n    precision_weighted_pe = np.dot(self.precision_y, sensory_pe)\\n    return -self.compute_jacobian(self.g).T @ precision_weighted_pe\\n```\\n\\n2. **Action Optimization**:\\n```python\\ndef update_action(self, dt):\\n    gradient = self.compute_action_gradient()\\n    self.action += dt * gradient\\n    self.action = self.constrain_action(self.action)\\n```\\n\\n## Implementation Considerations\\n\\n### 1. Numerical Integration\\n\\n#### Runge-Kutta 4th Order Implementation\\n```python\\ndef rk4_step(self, state, dt, dynamics_func):\\n    k1 = dynamics_func(state)\\n    k2 = dynamics_func(state + dt*k1/2)\\n    k3 = dynamics_func(state + dt*k2/2)\\n    k4 = dynamics_func(state + dt*k3)\\n    return state + dt*(k1 + 2*k2 + 2*k3 + k4)/6\\n```\\n\\n#### Adaptive Step Size Control\\n```python\\ndef adaptive_step(self, state, dt, tol=1e-6):\\n    dt_try = dt\\n    while True:\\n        state1 = self.rk4_step(state, dt_try, self.dynamics)\\n        state2 = self.rk4_step(state, dt_try/2, self.dynamics)\\n        state2 = self.rk4_step(state2, dt_try/2, self.dynamics)\\n        error = np.max(np.abs(state1 - state2))\\n        if error < tol:\\n            return state1, dt_try\\n        dt_try /= 2\\n```\\n\\n### 2.

You\\'re on one square (let\\'s call this your \"current state\"), and you want to move to another square (your \"next state\"). The B-matrix is like a rulebook that tells you the chances of where you\\'ll end up when you make a move.\\n\\n### A Simple Example: The Weather Game\\n\\nLet\\'s start with something we all understand: weather. Imagine a super-simple weather system with just three states:\\n- Sunny\\n- Cloudy\\n- Rainy\\n\\nAnd let\\'s say we have two actions we can take:\\n- Do a rain dance\\n- Use a fan\\n\\nThe B-matrix tells us what might happen when we take these actions.\\n\\n## How It Works\\n\\n### Example 1: No Action\\n\\nIf it\\'s sunny today and we do nothing:\\n- 70% chance it stays sunny tomorrow\\n- 20% chance it becomes cloudy\\n- 10% chance it rains\\n\\nWe can write this as:\\n```\\nStarting State: Sunny\\nChances for tomorrow:\\n  → Sunny:  70%\\n  → Cloudy: 20%\\n  → Rainy:  10%\\n```\\n\\n### Example 2: Taking Action\\n\\nNow, if we do a rain dance when it\\'s sunny:\\n- 30% chance it stays sunny\\n- 40% chance it becomes cloudy\\n- 30% chance it rains\\n\\n```\\nStarting State: Sunny + Rain Dance\\nChances for tomorrow:\\n  → Sunny:  30%\\n  → Cloudy: 40%\\n  → Rainy:  30%\\n```\\n\\n## Why It\\'s Useful\\n\\n### Making Predictions\\nThink of it like planning for a picnic. If you know:\\n1. Today\\'s weather\\n2. What actions might affect it\\n3. The chances of different outcomes\\n\\nYou can make better decisions about:\\n- When to schedule the picnic\\n- Whether to bring an umbrella\\n- If you should have a backup indoor plan\\n\\n### Real-World Examples\\n\\n#### Video Game Character\\n- Current state: Standing\\n- Action: Press jump button\\n- Possible next states:\\n  - 95% chance: In the air\\n  - 5% chance: Still standing (maybe you pressed the button wrong)\\n\\n#### Ice Cream Shop\\n- Current state: 10 customers in line\\n- Action: Add another server\\n- Possible next states:\\n  - 70% chance: Line gets shorter\\n  - 20% chance: Line stays same\\n  - 10% chance: Line gets longer (more people join)\\n\\n## The Big Picture\\n\\nThe B-matrix is like having a crystal ball, but instead of showing you exactly what will happen, it shows you all the possibilities and how likely each one is.\\n\\n### Key Points to Remember\\n\\n1. **States**: Where you are now and where you might end up\\n2. **Actions**: What you can do to try to change things\\n3. **Probabilities**: The chances of each possible outcome\\n\\n## Fun Analogies\\n\\n### The Board Game\\nThink of it like a special board game where:\\n- The squares are states\\n- The dice are weighted differently based on your actions\\n- The B-matrix is the rulebook telling you how the dice are weighted\\n\\n### The Recipe Book\\nOr think of it as a recipe book where:\\n- The current ingredients are your state\\n- Your cooking actions affect the dish\\n- But there\\'s always some uncertainty about how it\\'ll turn out\\n\\n## Common Questions\\n\\n### Q: Why isn\\'t it 100% certain?\\nA: Because real life isn\\'t certain! Just like you can\\'t be 100% sure it won\\'t rain on your birthday.\\n\\n### Q: Why do we need math for this?\\nA: The math helps us keep track of all the possibilities and make better predictions. It\\'s like having a really organized shopping list instead of trying to remember everything in your head.\\n\\n### Q: What\\'s the point?\\nA: It helps computers (or people) make better decisions by understanding:\\n- What might happen\\n- How likely each outcome is\\n- How our actions affect things\\n\\n## Try It Yourself!\\n\\n### Mini-Exercise: The Cookie Jar\\nImagine a cookie jar with:\\n- Current state: 5 cookies\\n- Action: Leave it near your little sister\\n- What are the chances of different numbers of cookies remaining?\\n\\nMake your own simple B-matrix:\\n```\\nStarting: 5 cookies\\nAction: Leave near sister\\nChances after 1 hour:\\n  → 5 cookies: 10%\\n  → 4 cookies: 20%\\n  → 3 cookies: 30%\\n  → 2 cookies: 25%\\n  → 1 cookie:  10%\\n  → 0 cookies: 5%\\n```\\n\\n## Wrap-Up\\n\\nThe B-matrix might sound fancy, but it\\'s really just a way to organize information about:\\n1. Where you are\\n2. What you can do\\n3. Where you might end up\\n\\nIt\\'s like having a weather forecast, but for any situation you want to predict!\\n\\n## Next Steps\\n\\nIf you\\'re interested in learning more:\\n- Try making B-matrices for simple everyday situations\\n- Think about how certain/uncertain different actions are\\n- Look for patterns in cause and effect around you\\n\\nRemember: You don\\'t need to understand all the math to get the basic idea.

Belief Representation\\n\\nBeliefs about states are represented in generalized coordinates:\\n```\\nq(x̃) = N(μ̃, Σ̃)\\n```\\nwhere:\\n- μ̃ is the vector of means across orders\\n- Σ̃ is the precision (inverse covariance) matrix\\n\\n### 2. Dynamics\\n\\nThe generalized motion of states follows:\\n```\\ndx̃/dt = Dx̃ - ∂F/∂x̃\\n```\\nwhere:\\n- D is the shift operator\\n- F is the variational free energy\\n- ∂F/∂x̃ are the gradients in generalized coordinates\\n\\n### 3. Prediction\\n\\nPredictions in generalized coordinates allow for:\\n- Smooth trajectories\\n- Velocity matching\\n- Acceleration matching\\n- Higher-order consistency\\n\\n## Implementation Details\\n\\n### 1. State Representation\\n\\n```python\\nclass ContinuousState:\\n    belief_means: np.ndarray      # Shape: [n_states, n_orders]\\n    belief_precisions: np.ndarray # Shape: [n_states, n_orders]\\n```\\n\\n### 2. Shift Operator\\n\\n```python\\ndef create_shift_operator(n_orders):\\n    D = np.zeros((n_orders, n_orders))\\n    for i in range(n_orders - 1):\\n        D[i, i+1] = factorial(i+1) / factorial(i)\\n    return D\\n```\\n\\n### 3. Free Energy\\n\\nThe free energy includes terms for all orders:\\n```\\nF = Σᵢ (prediction_errorᵢ)²/2σᵢ²\\n```\\nwhere i runs over all orders of motion.\\n\\n## Advantages\\n\\n1. **Smooth Dynamics**: Natural handling of continuous trajectories\\n2. **Rich Predictions**: Incorporation of velocity and acceleration\\n3. **Temporal Consistency**: Enforced across multiple orders\\n4. **Uncertainty Propagation**: Through all orders of motion\\n\\n## Visualization\\n\\n1. **State Space**: Plot of position vs. velocity\\n2. **Generalized Coordinates**: Multiple plots for each order\\n3. **Prediction Errors**: Across all orders of motion\\n4. **Taylor Expansions**: Showing predictive power\\n\\n## References\\n\\n1.

Represent continuous trajectories using discrete samples\\n2. Connect generalized coordinates to predictions\\n3. Formalize the relationship between different orders of motion\\n\\n## Mathematical Foundation\\n\\n### Basic Definition\\n\\nThe Taylor series expansion of a function f(t) around t₀ is:\\n\\n```\\nf(t) = f(t₀) + f'(t₀)(t-t₀) + f''(t₀)(t-t₀)²/2! + f'''(t₀)(t-t₀)³/3! + ...\\n```\\n\\nIn generalized coordinates, this becomes:\\n\\n```\\nf(t) = x + x'(t-t₀) + x''(t-t₀)²/2! + x'''(t-t₀)³/3! + ...\\n```\\n\\nwhere [x, x', x'', x'''] are the generalized coordinates.\\n\\n## Role in Active Inference\\n\\n### 1. Predictive Processing\\n\\nTaylor series enables:\\n- Forward predictions in time\\n- Smooth interpolation between time points\\n- Uncertainty propagation across orders\\n\\n### 2. Belief Updating\\n\\nThe relationship between orders is formalized through Taylor series:\\n```\\ndx/dt = x'\\ndx'/dt = x''\\ndx''/dt = x'''\\n```\\n\\n### 3. Error Minimization\\n\\nPrediction errors at each order contribute to free energy:\\n```\\nε₀ = y - g(x)           # Sensory prediction error\\nε₁ = x' - f(x)          # Motion prediction error\\nε₂ = x'' - f'(x)        # Acceleration prediction error\\n```\\n\\n## Implementation Details\\n\\n### 1. Expansion in Code\\n\\n```python\\ndef taylor_expansion(x0, orders, time_points):\\n    expansion = np.zeros_like(time_points)\\n    for n in range(orders + 1):\\n        expansion += (x0[n] / factorial(n)) * (time_points)**n\\n    return expansion\\n```\\n\\n### 2. Connection to Shift Operator\\n\\nThe shift operator D implements the Taylor series relationship:\\n```python\\ndef create_shift_operator(n_orders):\\n    D = np.zeros((n_orders, n_orders))\\n    for i in range(n_orders - 1):\\n        D[i, i+1] = factorial(i+1) / factorial(i)\\n    return D\\n```\\n\\n### 3. Prediction Generation\\n\\n```python\\ndef predict_future(current_state, dt):\\n    prediction = np.zeros_like(current_state)\\n    for n in range(len(current_state)):\\n        prediction += current_state[n] * dt**n / factorial(n)\\n    return prediction\\n```\\n\\n## Advantages\\n\\n1. **Smooth Predictions**: Natural interpolation between time points\\n2. **Error Hierarchy**: Structured prediction errors across orders\\n3. **Temporal Consistency**: Enforced through series relationships\\n4. **Computational Efficiency**: Truncated series for approximation\\n\\n## Visualization\\n\\n1. **Expansion Accuracy**: Compare different orders of expansion\\n2. **Prediction Quality**: Show how higher orders improve predictions\\n3. **Error Analysis**: Visualize errors at different orders\\n4. **Convergence**: Show how adding terms improves accuracy\\n\\n## Example Analysis\\n\\n### 1. Expansion Accuracy\\n\\n```python\\n# Plot different orders of Taylor expansion\\norders = [1, 2, 3, 4]\\ntime_points = np.linspace(0, 1, 100)\\nx0 = get_initial_state()  # [x, x', x'', x''']\\n\\nfor order in orders:\\n    expansion = taylor_expansion(x0, order, time_points)\\n    plt.plot(time_points, expansion, label=f'Order {order}')\\n```\\n\\n### 2. Error Analysis\\n\\n```python\\n# Compare prediction errors at different orders\\nfor order in range(n_orders):\\n    errors = compute_prediction_errors(order)\\n    plt.subplot(n_orders, 1, order+1)\\n    plt.plot(time_points, errors)\\n    plt.title(f'Order {order} Errors')\\n```\\n\\n## References\\n\\n1.

Euler-Lagrange Equation\\nThe necessary condition for optimality (see [[optimization_theory]], [[calculus_of_variations]]):\\n\\n```math\\n\\\\frac{\\\\partial L}{\\\\partial f} - \\\\frac{d}{dx}\\\\frac{\\\\partial L}{\\\\partial f\\'} = 0\\n```\\n\\n### 3. Connection to Inference\\nIn variational inference (see [[variational_inference]], [[bayesian_inference]], [[information_theory]]), we optimize over probability distributions:\\n\\n```math\\n\\\\mathcal{F}[q] = \\\\mathbb{E}_q[\\\\ln q(z) - \\\\ln p(x,z)]\\n```\\n\\nwhere:\\n- $q(z)$ is the variational distribution (see [[probability_theory]])\\n- $p(x,z)$ is the joint distribution\\n- $\\\\mathcal{F}$ is the variational free energy (see [[free_energy_principle]])\\n\\n## Implementation Framework\\n\\n### 1.

All of the nodes are like ships or towers, that are doing this real-time inference on how much to ascend or descend in order to stay within a tolerable limited range of the overall sea level (which floats all boats).\\n\\n## Project Structure\\n\\n```\\npath_network/\\n├── core/\\n│   ├── __init__.py\\n│   ├── agent.py              # Active Inference agent implementation\\n│   ├── network.py            # Network topology and communication\\n│   ├── dynamics.py           # Sin wave and environmental dynamics\\n│   └── inference.py          # Generalized coordinates and inference methods\\n├── utils/\\n│   ├── __init__.py\\n│   ├── visualization.py      # Network and dynamics visualization\\n│   └── math_utils.py         # Mathematical utilities\\n├── config/\\n│   ├── __init__.py\\n│   └── settings.py           # Simulation parameters\\n└── simulation/\\n    ├── __init__.py\\n    └── runner.py             # Main simulation orchestration\\n```\\n\\n## Core Components\\n\\n### 1.

These binary\\nnumbers are made up of 3 contiguous fields of bits, from left to right:\\n\\n1. 1 sign bit\\n2. 11 exponent bits\\n3. 52 mantissa bits\\n\\nDepending on the values these fields have, the represented mathematical object\\ncan be one of:\\n\\n* Floating point number\\n* Zero\\n* NaN\\n* Infinite\\n\\n## Floating Point Numbers\\n\\nIEEE 754 represents a floating point number $f$ using an exponential\\nnotation with 4 components: $sign$, $mantissa$, $base$ and $exponent$:\\n\\n$$f = sign \\\\times mantissa \\\\times base ^ {exponent}$$\\n\\nThere are two possible representations of floating point numbers:\\n_normal_ and _denormal_, which have different valid values for\\ntheir $mantissa$ and $exponent$ fields.\\n\\n### Binary Representation\\n\\n$sign$, $mantissa$, and $exponent$ are represented in binary, the\\nrepresentation of each component has certain details explained next.\\n\\n$base$ is always $2$ and it is not represented in binary.\\n\\n#### Sign\\n\\n$sign$ can have 2 values:\\n\\n1. $1$ if the `sign` bit is `0`\\n2. $-1$ if the `sign` bit is `1`.\\n\\n#### Mantissa\\n\\n##### Normal Floating Point Numbers\\n\\n$mantissa$ is a positive fractional number whose integer part is $1$, for example\\n$1.2345 \\\\dots$. The `mantissa` bits represent only the fractional part and the\\n$mantissa$ value can be calculated as:\\n\\n$$mantissa = 1 + \\\\sum_{i=1}^{52} b_{i} \\\\times 2^{-i} = 1 + \\\\frac{b_{1}}{2^{1}} + \\\\frac{b_{2}}{2^{2}} + \\\\dots + \\\\frac{b_{51}}{2^{51}} + \\\\frac{b_{52}}{2^{52}}$$\\n\\nWhere $b_{i}$ is:\\n\\n1. $0$ if the bit at the position `i - 1` is `0`.\\n2. $1$ if the bit at the position `i - 1` is `1`.\\n\\n##### Denormal Floating Point Numbers\\n\\n$mantissa$ is a positive fractional number whose integer part is $0$, for example\\n$0.12345 \\\\dots$. The `mantissa` bits represent only the fractional part and the\\n$mantissa$ value can be calculated as:\\n\\n$$mantissa = \\\\sum_{i=1}^{52} b_{i} \\\\times 2^{-i} = \\\\frac{b_{1}}{2^{1}} + \\\\frac{b_{2}}{2^{2}} + \\\\dots + \\\\frac{b_{51}}{2^{51}} + \\\\frac{b_{52}}{2^{52}}$$\\n\\nWhere $b_{i}$ is:\\n\\n1. $0$ if the bit at the position `i - 1` is `0`.\\n2. $1$ if the bit at the position `i - 1` is `1`.\\n\\n#### Exponent\\n\\n##### Normal Floating Point Numbers\\n\\nOnly the following bit sequences are allowed: `00000000001` to `11111111110`.\\nThat is, there must be at least one `0` and one `1` in the exponent bits.\\n\\nThe actual value of the $exponent$ can be calculated as:\\n\\n$$exponent = v - bias$$\\n\\nwhere $v$ is the value of the binary number in the exponent bits and $bias$ is $1023$.\\nConsidering the restrictions above, the respective minimum and maximum values for the\\nexponent are:\\n\\n1. `00000000001` = $1$, $1 - 1023 = -1022$\\n2. `11111111110` = $2046$, $2046 - 1023 = 1023$\\n\\nSo, $exponent$ is an integer in the range $\\\\left[-1022, 1023\\\\right]$.\\n\\n\\n##### Denormal Floating Point Numbers\\n\\n$exponent$ is always $-1022$. Nevertheless, it is always represented as `00000000000`.\\n\\n### Normal and Denormal Floating Point Numbers\\n\\nThe smallest absolute value a normal floating point number can have is calculated\\nlike this:\\n\\n$$1 \\\\times 1.0\\\\dots0 \\\\times 2^{-1022} = 2.2250738585072014 \\\\times 10^{-308}$$\\n\\nSince normal floating point numbers always have a $1$ as the integer part of the\\n$mantissa$, then smaller values can be achieved by using the smallest possible exponent\\n( $-1022$ ) and a $0$ in the integer part of the $mantissa$, but significant digits are lost.\\n\\nThe smallest absolute value a denormal floating point number can have is calculated\\nlike this:\\n\\n$$1 \\\\times 2^{-52} \\\\times 2^{-1022} = 5 \\\\times 10^{-324}$$\\n\\n## Zero\\n\\nZero is represented like this:\\n\\n* Sign bit: `X`\\n* Exponent bits: `00000000000`\\n* Mantissa bits: `0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000`\\n\\nwhere `X` means `0` or `1`.\\n\\n## NaN\\n\\nThere are 2 kinds of NaNs that are represented:\\n\\n1. QNaNs (Quiet NaNs): represent the result of indeterminate operations.\\n2. SNaNs (Signalling NaNs): represent the result of invalid operations.\\n\\n### QNaNs\\n\\nQNaNs are represented like this:\\n\\n* Sign bit: `X`\\n* Exponent bits: `11111111111`\\n* Mantissa bits: `1XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX`\\n\\nwhere `X` means `0` or `1`.\\n\\n### SNaNs\\n\\nSNaNs are represented like this:\\n\\n* Sign bit: `X`\\n* Exponent bits: `11111111111`\\n* Mantissa bits: `0XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX1`\\n\\nwhere `X` means `0` or `1`.\\n\\n## Infinite\\n\\n### Positive Infinite\\n\\nPositive infinite is represented like this:\\n\\n* Sign bit: `0`\\n* Exponent bits: `11111111111`\\n* Mantissa bits: `0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000`\\n\\nwhere `X` means `0` or `1`.\\n\\n### Negative Infinite\\n\\nNegative infinite is represented like this:\\n\\n* Sign bit: `1`\\n* Exponent bits: `11111111111`\\n* Mantissa bits: `0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000`\\n\\nwhere `X` means `0` or `1`.\\n', 'embedding': array([0.4316448 , 0.69616681, 0.57484323, ..., 0.68591654, 1.47004557,\n",
