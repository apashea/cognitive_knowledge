## Overview

Free Energy Minimization is the fundamental principle underlying adaptive behavior in biological and artificial systems. It posits that all adaptive systems act to minimize their variational free energy, which measures the discrepancy between their internal models and environmental reality.

## Mathematical Framework

### Variational Free Energy
```math
F = E_q[\ln q(s) - \ln p(s,o)] = D_{KL}[q(s)||p(s|o)] - \ln p(o)
```

where:
- $q(s)$ is the recognition density (internal model)
- $p(s,o)$ is the generative model
- $D_{KL}$ is the Kullback-Leibler divergence
- $p(o)$ is the evidence (marginal likelihood)
