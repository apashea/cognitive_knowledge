# Systems Theory

## Overview

Systems theory provides a transdisciplinary framework for understanding complex phenomena through the lens of systems and their interactions. This theoretical framework is fundamental to understanding cognitive systems, emergent behavior, and complex biological systems.

## Core Concepts

### 1. System Properties
- **Wholeness**: Systems must be understood as wholes rather than collections of parts
- **Hierarchy**: Systems exist within systems (subsystems and supersystems)
- **Emergence**: System-level properties emerge from component interactions
- **Self-organization**: Systems can spontaneously develop order
- **Feedback**: Systems regulate through feedback loops

### 2. System Dynamics
- **Homeostasis**: System stability through self-regulation
- **Adaptation**: System changes in response to environment
- **Evolution**: Long-term system development
- **Phase Transitions**: Qualitative changes in system behavior
- **Attractors**: Stable states toward which systems tend
