## Overview

Stigmergy describes a mechanism of indirect coordination between agents through modifications of their environment. This form of coordination emerges when agents leave traces in the environment that influence the behavior of other agents, leading to complex collective behaviors without direct communication or central control.

## Key Principles

### Environmental Mediation
- Environment serves as a shared memory
- Modifications persist over time
- Information is spatially localized
- Asynchronous interaction between agents

### Self-Organization
- Emergent global patterns
- Decentralized control
- Positive and negative feedback loops
- Local interactions leading to global order

### Information Processing
- Distributed memory system
- Dynamic information updating
- Signal degradation over time
- Pattern formation and maintenance

## Examples in Nature

### Ant Colony Organization
- Pheromone trail systems
- Nest construction
- Food foraging patterns
- Territory marking

### Termite Construction
- Mound building
- Climate regulation
- Structural maintenance
- Colony organization

## Applications

### Artificial Systems
- Swarm robotics
- Distributed computing
- Urban planning
- Traffic management

### Human Systems
- Social media dynamics
- Knowledge management
- Urban development
- Digital collaboration
