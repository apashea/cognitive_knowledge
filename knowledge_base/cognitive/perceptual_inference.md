## Overview

Perceptual Inference is the process by which the brain constructs its understanding of the sensory world through a combination of bottom-up sensory information and top-down predictions. This process is fundamental to predictive processing theories and explains how perception emerges from the continuous interplay between sensory data and prior knowledge.

## Theoretical Framework

### Bayesian Formulation
```math
P(s|o) = \frac{P(o|s)P(s)}{P(o)}
```
where:
- $P(s|o)$ is the posterior probability of states given observations
- $P(o|s)$ is the likelihood of observations given states
- $P(s)$ is the prior probability of states
- $P(o)$ is the marginal likelihood
