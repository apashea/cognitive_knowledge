## Overview

Cognitive Development encompasses the emergence, maturation, and refinement of mental abilities across the lifespan. This process involves complex interactions between genetic programs, environmental influences, and experience-dependent plasticity, leading to the development of perception, attention, memory, language, reasoning, and social understanding.
